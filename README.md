#This is a game with a rolling ball that the player controls to pick up items.  There are 12 items to pick up.
#If they pick all the items before the enemy reaches them, they win.
#A UI screen keeps count of the score as well announces if there is a win or loss.
#Pre-fab items include the pick up boxes and the light weight dynamic boxes which can move when collided with.
#The enemy walks along a baked path within the game.
